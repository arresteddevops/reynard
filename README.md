# Reynard #

This is a fork of Adrian's great looking foxslide theme for octopress.

## Navbar

Instead of the *About me* and the other social widgets that appear in
the original foxslide, `reynard` has a navbar. I did this because my
blog is also my personal website and I needed a navbar to stick in a
few custom links.

## New background

I also replaced the original photo from foxslide with a wonderful black and
white from Carrie Nelson that I found
[here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/69912667@N07/6778147487/). It is

## Spacelab from Bootswatch

Since the original foxslide is built upon Bootstrap by Twitter, it was
simple to switch it out with
[Spacelab](http://bootswatch.com/spacelab/).
